## About Me

After nearly two decades in higher education, I transitioned to industry and am currently a Lead Business Systems Analyst in Hydropower Generation Asset Management. I am currently rediscovering the joy of learning something new, and I am pursuing a second master's degree in Applied Data Science with a specialization in machine learning. I expect to graduate in late 2024.
