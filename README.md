# Applied Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

After nearly two decades in higher education, I transitioned to industry and am currently a Lead Business Systems Analyst in Hydropower Asset Management. I am 80% through a second master's degree in Applied Data Science with a Specialist Concentration (calculus and linear algebra-based) and hope to spend the next chapter in my career focused on advanced statistical modeling and data analysis. I expect to graduate in October 2024.
